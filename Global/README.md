## Project
OTServ Brasil - Global Server is a free and open-source MMORPG server emulator written in C++. It is a fork of the [Forgotten Server](https://github.com/otland/forgottenserver) project. To connect to the server and to take a stable experience, you can use our [own client](https://forums.otserv.com.br/index.php?/forums/topic/167933-otservbr-global-cliente-tibia-12/) and if you want to edit something, check our [customized tools](https://github.com/opentibiabr/tools).

### Getting Started
* **WARNING: YOU NEED TO UNZIP THE MAP BEFORE START THE SERVER.**
* [Compiling on Windows](https://forums.otserv.com.br/index.php?/forums/topic/169235-windowsvc2019-compilando-sources-otservbr-global/), alternatively download [nightly builds for Windows](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/opentibiabr/otservbr-global).

### Issues
We use the [issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/dudantas/otservbr-global/issues). Keep in mind that everyone who is watching the repository gets notified by e-mail when there is an activity, so be thoughtful and avoid writing comments that aren't meant for an issue (e.g. "+1"). If you'd like for an issue to be fixed faster, you should either fix it yourself and submit a pull request, or place a bounty on the issue.
